								<p>Over the years, Poetica Musica has developed a reputation for performing unique and seldom-heard repertoire with interesting and unusual vocal and instrumental combinations. It has premiered, and introduced contemporary compositions as well as more standard repertoire to audiences worldwide. Poetica Musica’s performances of jazz-influenced, popular and contemporary music appeals to young audiences, and older audiences alike.</p>

								<p>Poetica Musica has performed and given master classes in more than one hundred elementary schools, high schools, music conservatories, and community centers worldwide. Their presentations in schools are interactive encouraging the students to actively participate in all activities such as “Jam sessions” with the members of  Poetica Musica. Students are encouraged to perform, touch and play the instruments used in the concerts and master classes and to “sing along” with the professionals.</p>

								<p>Dubbed “Good Will Ambassadors” in an article in the New York Times, Poetica Musica has committed itself to programs focusing on cultural exchange and has also provided talented foreign musicians with the opportunity to perform in the United States. Sharing the philosophy that cultural exchange builds bridges of understanding between diverse cultures, Poetica Musica has collaborated with the Embassies and Consulates of the Czech Republic, Brazil, Russia, Spain Norway, Serbia, Poland and Denmark in order to introduce seldom-heard repertoire and distinguished foreign musicians to the American public.  Poetica Musica served as hosts to two prominent Danish musicians who appeared as guest artists with the ensemble in Carnegie Hall and at  other venues nationwide performing contemporary works by Danish composers.</p>

								<p>Promoting American chamber music and literature abroad remains one of the Poetica Musica’s most important responsibilities. For the past ten years, Poetica Musica has toured the world under the auspices of the United States State Department performing, lecturing and teaching the American chamber music repertoire and introducing emerging American composers and compositions as well as more established names to the overseas public. They have toured in more than fifty countries including Denmark, Norway, Israel, Syria, Turkey, Peru, Tajikistan, Guyana, and India among others.</p>

								<p>Committed to historic preservation worldwide, Poetica Musica has given benefit concerts to raise money for the restoration of UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES. The group has raised money in Berlin, Paris, Washington, New York and Prague to benefit the Baroque Theater of the Cesky Krumlov Chateau, one of six remaining Baroque Theaters in the world. The ensemble has also collaborated with the American Friends of the State Hermitage Museum in New York.</p>

								<p>Helping to promote cultural exchange, Poetica  Musica has invited music students from the developing world to visit New York City to participate in master classes, individual lessons and attend musical performances. In a recent project in cooperation with the United States Embassy in Peru and the Music Conservatory in Lima, two promising young Peruvian singers were invited to visit New York under the sponsorship of Poetica Musica; they received instruction in vocal technique, interpretation of song, and visited various music conservatories including the Juilliard school of Music. Poetica Musica have collaborated and sponsored the young Serbian pianist, Natasa Mitrovic performing with her at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and appeared with the Danish group, Ensemble Nordlys at New York’s Carnegie Hall.</p>

								<p>Poetica Musica will continue its humanitarian works in the coming years by performing benefit concerts for organizations that support historic preservation, education, and humanitarian causes. They were instrumental in founding the International Chamber Music Festival in Ulcinj, Montenegro which presents musicians from the former Yugoslavia as well as prominent international artists.</p>
